# Music Genre Classification
This repository contains code for testing and comparing the performance of various machine learning algorithms in classifying music genres using the GTZAN dataset from Kaggle.

### Implemented Algorithms
* k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Neural Networks (NNs)
* Decision Trees

#### Usage
1. Data: The data/ folder is already populated with the GTZAN dataset.
2. Run the notebooks: Each algorithm has its own folder. Navigate to the respective model folder and run the Jupyter notebook to preprocess the data, train, and evaluate the model.
